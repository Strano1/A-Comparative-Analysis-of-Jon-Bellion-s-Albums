# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Jon-Bellion-s-Albums
In this data scraping project, I make use of Spotipy to scrape data on an artist, Jon Bellion, and carry out an exploratory and comparative analysis of his albums. This project sets to find out his most popular album, most popular track, correlation between the track features, average of track features in every album, and the tracks with the highest amount of each track feature. I also included notes to show what details each line of code aims to find out.

Here's a preview of the project on Python.
